# Demand Planning-Dashboard

A Demand Planning Dashboard in Power BI provides a clear, visual overview of forecasted demand, actual sales, inventory levels, and key performance indicators (KPIs). It's a valuable tool for supply chain and planning teams to make data-driven decisions, reduce stockouts or overstock situations, and improve forecasting accuracy. Centralizing insights in a dynamic, interactive dashboard enhances collaboration across teams and helps efficiently align supply with customer demand.
