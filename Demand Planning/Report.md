# Demand Planning-Dashboard

A Demand Planning Dashboard in Power BI provides a clear, visual overview of forecasted demand, actual sales, inventory levels, and key performance indicators (KPIs). It's a valuable tool for supply chain and planning teams to make data-driven decisions, reduce stockouts or overstock situations, and improve forecasting accuracy. By centralizing insights in a dynamic, interactive dashboard, it enhances collaboration across teams and helps align supply with customer demand efficiently.
